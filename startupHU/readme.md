This is the prototype for the StartupHU website, it is very barebones and is in blog format rather than in the true website idea. The proof of concept is much better, please judge that ovr this and judge that as if it were the actual website. The website was my first time trying Flask and learning how to do so and that was not an easy task. I feel like our idea was pretty good and getting somewhere and had we had a year or two of experience more, we might have been able to accomplish it.

Thanks for reading honorable judges, I hope you liked our presentation. We tried to fit this into the financial track and the JP Morgan one. If we were better, we would have tried to add more analytical data for small businesses but we ran out of time so.... Yeah.
